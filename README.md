## Project for Module 1 Validation of the PHP Course

### ONLINE STORE - PHP COURSE PROJECT

The main idea behind this project was to create an online store with some user controls and permissions.

The web system has several functionalities, such as:

    - Registration of new users
      |- With JS validations to avoid users with the same names and/or emails.
    - Login page
    - There are 2 types of accounts: customer and administrator:
        -- Administrator
        |- Access to all customer orders
        |- Add/Update/Delete products
        |- Change user role, such as Customer -> Administrator & Administrator -> Customer
    - List of all products
    - View each product with additional information not present in the listing
    - Add products to the shopping cart
    - Listing of each customer's individual orders
    - Change password
